// CRYPTOLITE peripheral driver for PSC3.
//
// This module currently exposes TRNG control and data-read APIs.
//
// Typical TRNG usage sequence:
// 1. Create a `Cryptolite` instance.
// 2. Call `trng_init(None)` or provide a custom `TrngConfig`.
// 3. Call `trng_enable()`.
// 4. Call `trng_read_data()`.
// 5. Call `trng_disable()` when finished.
//
// `trng_read_data()` returns `Err(CryptoliteErr::TrngUnhealthy)` when
// adaptive proportion or repetition count checks detect unhealthy entropy.
